# Introduction
For this project, we sought to identify two trends in a climate data set, and forecast them into the future. This investigation focused on the warming of the sea surface temperature of the Arctic Ocean over time. For our additional step, we investigated how the increase in temperature in the Arctic ocean impacted the percentage of time its temperature is below freezing.

# Data
 The data was taken from ERA5 at 
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview, which is created by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting.

# Data Analysis
To analyze and forecast the Arctic ocean weather data, moving average and prophet models were used, along with other more rudimentary data visualizations. 

# File Names
The file containing data analysis is titled arctic_temp_forecast.ipynb
